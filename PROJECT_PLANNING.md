# Project Planning Template

Welcome! This template helps you plan your coding project before diving into implementation. Taking 10-15 minutes to plan will save you time and frustration later.

## 📋 Project Information

**Project Name:** _[e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe Game]_

**Your Name(s):** _________________________

**Date Started:** _________________________

**Estimated Completion:** _________________________

## 🎯 Project Goals

### What are you building?
Write 2-3 sentences describing your project in plain language.

_Example: I'm building a two-player tic-tac-toe game where players take turns marking positions on a 3x3 grid. The game will detect wins, losses, and ties, and display the board after each move._

**Your description:**

## 📊 Visual Planning

### Diagram Your System

Use a visual diagram tool to sketch out:
- How different parts of your code will work together
- What functions/classes you'll need
- The flow of your program from start to finish

**Recommended Tool:** [Diagrams.net (draw.io)](https://app.diagrams.net/)
- Free, no account needed
- Works in browser
- Save diagrams to Google Drive or download as PNG

**What to diagram:**
- **Flowchart:** Show the step-by-step flow of your program
- **System Architecture:** Show how different functions/modules connect
- **Data Structures:** Visualize how you'll organize information (lists, dictionaries, etc.)

**Link to your diagram:** _________________________ _(optional - paste link if saved to Google Drive)_

Or attach/describe your hand-drawn sketch:

## 🏗️ Implementation Plan

### Step-by-Step Build Order
What order will you build features? Start with the simplest piece that you can test.

| Step | Feature/Component | Can Test It By... | Status |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1    | | | ⬜️ Not Started |
| 2    | | | ⬜️ Not Started |
| 3    | | | ⬜️ Not Started |
| 4    | | | ⬜️ Not Started |
| 5    | | | ⬜️ Not Started |

**Status Key:** ⬜️ Not Started | 🟨 In Progress | ✅ Complete | ❌ Blocked

## ✨ Tips for Success

- **Start small:** Get the simplest version working first, then add features
- **Test frequently:** Run your code after every small change
- **Ask specific questions:** Instead of "it doesn't work," say "when I run X, I expect Y but get Z"
- **Commit progress:** Save/commit working versions before making big changes
- **Take breaks:** Step away when stuck - solutions often come when you're not staring at the screen

**Remember:** The goal is learning, not perfection. Understanding why code works is more valuable than having elegant code that remains mysterious.
