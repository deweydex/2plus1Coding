- **15-30 min:** Display board + input
- **30-50 min:** Turn alternation + win detection
- **50-80 min:** Enhancements

### Word Guessing
- **0-15 min:** Planning

## Success Indicators

### You're on track if:
- ⏰ **By 30 min:** You have something you can run and see output
- ⏰ **By 50 min:** Your MVP is mostly working
- ⏰ **By 70 min:** You're adding enhancements or polishing

### You might be stuck if:
- ⏰ **By 30 min:** You haven't run any code yet
- ⏰ **By 50 min:** Basic features still aren't working
- → **Solution:** Simplify! Focus on one working feature

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Can we switch projects mid-way?**
A: Not recommended. Finishing one simple project is better than half-finishing a complex one.

**Q: What if we finish early?**
A: Great! Add enhancements from your handout. There are lots of ideas to explore.

**Q: What if we're behind schedule?**
A: Focus on getting your MVP working well. A simple, working project is better than a complex broken one.

**Q: Can we combine projects?**
A: Not recommended for this workshop. Master one concept first!

**Q: We're totally lost, what do we do?**
A: Ask your facilitator! Also, try starting with an even simpler version. Can you just display something? Start there.

## Final Recommendation

**If unsure, start with Tic-Tac-Toe.** It has:
- Clearest structure
- Highest success rate
- Best learning progression
- Can always switch to another project next time

**The best project is the one you'll finish and understand!**

## Mix and Match for Multiple Sessions

If you're running multiple workshops:

**Session 1:** Tic-Tac-Toe (learn basics)
**Session 2:** Word Guessing (practice strings)
**Session 3:** RPG Battle (apply everything)

Each builds on skills from the previous project!
