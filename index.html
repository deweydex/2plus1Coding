        <h1>Coding with AI: Learning to Program with AI Assistance</h1>

        <div class="intro">
            This activity introduces you to working with AI tools to write, understand, and improve code. Over the course of 80-90 minutes, you will work through one of five project options, learning not just how to write code, but how to think about problems, break them into manageable pieces, and communicate effectively with AI coding assistants.
        </div>

            <h2>Choose Your Setup</h2>
            <p>
                This activity can be completed using either a desktop-based setup or entirely in the web browser. Both approaches teach the same concepts and complete the same projects. Choose the option that best fits your situation, technical environment, and preferences.

                <strong>Not sure which to choose?</strong> If you are working in a classroom, on a Chromebook, or unfamiliar with command-line tools, choose the web-based version. If you want the most integrated experience and are comfortable installing software, choose the desktop version. Both versions work equally well for learning.

            <h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
            <p>
                This workshop is designed around experiential learning principles. Rather than passively receiving information, you will actively construct understanding through building a working project. The focus is not on memorizing syntax or completing a perfect product, but on developing problem-solving skills and learning to work effectively with modern development tools.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout this activity, you will develop several key competencies. You will learn to break complex problems into smaller, testable components. You will practice reading and understanding code that you did not write yourself, a critical skill for any developer. You will experience the iterative nature of software development, where testing and refinement are continuous processes rather than final steps. Most importantly, you will learn to prompt AI tools effectively, understanding both their capabilities and limitations.
            </p>

            <p>
                The projects range from game development to data visualization to machine learning, offering multiple entry points based on your interests and experience level. Each project includes both beginner and advanced starter code, ensuring that you can work at an appropriate level of challenge while still being stretched beyond your current comfort zone.

            <h2>Activity Timeline</h2>
            <p>
                The 80-90 minute session is structured to balance planning, building, and reflection. This structure mirrors professional software development practices, where thoughtful design prevents later confusion and regular reflection drives improvement.
            </p>

            <div class="timeline">
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <div class="timeline-time">0-15 minutes</div>
                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        <h4>Phase 1: Planning and Design</h4>
                        <p>
                            Before writing any code, you will work with your partner to understand the project requirements and sketch out an approach. This phase involves identifying the core features needed for a minimum viable product, discussing what data structures might be appropriate, and creating a rough plan for how to build incrementally. Effective planning at this stage prevents frustration later and helps you maintain focus on what matters most.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        <h4>Phase 2: Building the Core</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is the heart of the activity, where you will use Claude Code to build your project step by step. The emphasis is on incremental development: add one feature, test it, understand it, then move to the next. You will start with the starter code provided, which gives you a working baseline to build upon. As you work, you will practice crafting clear prompts, reading the code that Claude generates, and testing frequently to ensure each piece works before adding complexity.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h4>Phase 3: Enhancement and Polish</h4>
                        <p>
                            Once your core functionality works, you will add enhancements based on your interests and remaining time. This might include input validation, improved user interfaces, additional features, or optimization. This phase allows you to explore aspects of the project that interest you most while practicing the important skill of knowing when a project is "done enough" versus when additional work adds real value.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Phase 4: Demonstration and Reflection</h4>
                        <p>
                            The session concludes with pairs demonstrating their projects to each other and reflecting on the learning process. This reflection is not merely a summary, but an opportunity to think critically about what strategies worked well, what was challenging, and how you might approach similar problems in the future. This metacognitive practice helps solidify learning and transfer skills to new contexts.

            <h2>Working in Pairs</h2>
            <p>
                This activity is designed for pair programming, where two students work together at one computer. This is not simply a division of labor, but a collaborative approach where both participants actively engage with the problem. Research in computer science education consistently shows that pair programming leads to better learning outcomes, higher quality code, and improved problem-solving skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                If pairs have mixed experience levels, the more experienced student takes on a mentoring role. This does not mean doing the work for the other person. Instead, it means asking guiding questions, helping interpret error messages, and ensuring both partners understand each step before moving forward. Teaching someone else is one of the most effective ways to solidify your own understanding.
            </p>

            <p>
                For students working alone, the projects are still fully accessible. You will simply take on both roles yourself: thinking through problems, implementing solutions, and then critically reviewing your own work. The prompting guide and project instructions provide the scaffolding needed to work independently.
            </p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
                Before beginning your project, you will need to set up your chosen environment. If you selected the web-based version, the <a href="getting-started-web.html">Web-Based Getting Started</a> page walks you through setting up Claude.ai and Google Colab accounts. If you chose the desktop version, the <a href="getting-started.html">Desktop Getting Started</a> page guides you through installation and configuration. Even if you have prior experience, review the appropriate guide to understand the specific workflow for this activity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once your environment is ready, review the <a href="prompting-guide.html">Prompting Guide</a> to understand how to communicate effectively with AI coding assistants. This guide goes beyond simple tips to explain the architectural principles that make certain prompting strategies effective. Understanding why specific approaches work will help you adapt when you encounter novel situations.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you are ready to begin, select a project that matches your interests and experience level, and dive in. Remember that the goal is learning, not perfection. Working code that you understand is far more valuable than elegant code that remains mysterious.
