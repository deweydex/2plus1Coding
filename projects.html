                </p>

                <h4>What You'll Build</h4>
                <p>
                    Create character classes with health and stats, implement attack and defense mechanics, design a turn-based battle loop, and display combat information clearly.
                </p>

                <h4>Creative Directions</h4>
                <p>
                    Design unique character classes with special abilities, add equipment and inventory systems, implement status effects (poison, stun, buffs), create enemy AI with different strategies, build a party system with multiple characters, add experience points and leveling, or design a story campaign with multiple battles.
                </p>

            <h2>Choosing Your Project</h2>
            <p>
                Consider both your <strong>current skill level</strong> and your <strong>interests</strong>. A beginner-friendly project with an interesting theme will be more engaging than an advanced project outside your comfort zone. You can always return to complete additional projects after finishing your first one.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each project page includes detailed instructions, starter code in both beginner and advanced versions, and guidance on working with AI to build your solution. The creative directions are entirely optional but provide inspiration for extending your project beyond the basics.
            </p>

            <h3>Not Sure Where to Start?</h3>
            <p>
                If you are completely new to programming, <strong>Tic-Tac-Toe</strong> offers the gentlest introduction with immediate visual feedback. If you have some programming experience, choose based on what excites you most. The learning happens through doing, so pick something you will enjoy building.
