## 📊 Project Recommendations by Skill Level

### For Absolute Beginners
**Recommended:** Tic-Tac-Toe
- Simplest structure
- Highest success rate
- Clear progression

### For Students with Some Python
**Recommended:** Word Guessing Game
- Good balance of challenge
- Creative freedom
- Interesting string operations

### For Confident Students
**Recommended:** RPG Battle
- Most complex
- Teaches game design
- Lots of enhancement potential

**Remember:** It's better to complete a simple project than to half-finish a complex one!

   - Ask for explanations
   - Debug with AI assistance

2. **Plan before coding**
   - Break projects into steps
   - Identify core features
   - Design game flow

3. **Test incrementally**
   - Run code after each feature
   - Verify functionality
   - Debug issues as they arise

4. **Read and understand code**
   - Explain what code does
   - Identify functions and their purposes
   - Trace through program flow

5. **Collaborate on coding**
   - Share knowledge between skill levels
   - Explain concepts to partners
   - Make decisions together

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Facilitators

**Do:**
- ✅ Emphasize planning before coding
- ✅ Encourage testing after each change
- ✅ Let students struggle a bit (productive struggle)
- ✅ Celebrate working code, even if simple
- ✅ Help pairs communicate effectively

**Don't:**
- ❌ Rush to give answers
- ❌ Let advanced students do all the work
- ❌ Allow students to skip testing
- ❌ Accept "I don't know" without trying
- ❌ Let pairs build without understanding

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** "Advanced student is doing everything"
→ Remind them: "Your job is to teach, not to code"
→ Have beginner type all prompts

**Issue:** "We're stuck and lost"
→ Ask: "What should happen? What's happening instead?"
→ Suggest starting simpler

**Issue:** "We finished too early"
→ Point to enhancement ideas
→ Suggest code review for clarity
→ Have them help another pair

**Issue:** "Our code is broken and we don't know why"
→ Ask them to explain error message
→ Have them describe what they expected
→ Help them form debugging prompt for Claude Code

- "Why did Claude Code use this approach?"

**For Advanced Students:**
- "How would you explain this to someone new?"
- "What edge cases could break this?"
- "How could this code be improved?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"
