```

## Available Notebooks

### Beginner Level
- `tictactoe_beginner.ipynb` - Tic-Tac-Toe game with board display
- `ml_beginner.ipynb` - Machine Learning classification intro

### Advanced Level
- (More notebooks to be added)

## Creating More Notebooks

To convert a Python starter file to a Colab notebook:
1. Create a new `.ipynb` file in this directory
2. Follow the JSON structure shown in existing notebooks
3. Break code into logical cells with markdown explanations
4. Add suggested prompts for Claude.ai
5. Include workspace cells for students to add their code

## For Teachers

These notebooks work well with Claude.ai because:
- Students can run code immediately without installation
- Easy to copy code blocks to Claude.ai for help
- Markdown cells provide inline instructions
- All libraries pre-installed in Colab environment
- Free GPU available for ML projects
