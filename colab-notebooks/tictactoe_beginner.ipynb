    "## What you're starting with:\n",
    "- A working board display function (run the code below to see it!)\n",
    "- Basic game structure ready to expand\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your tasks:\n",
    "1. Add a function to let a player make a move\n",
    "2. Create a game loop so players can alternate turns\n",
    "3. Add win detection (check rows, columns, diagonals)\n",
    "4. Handle tie games\n",
    "5. Add enhancements based on your interests\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use this notebook:\n",
    "1. **Run the starter code** below to see what you have\n",
    "2. **Copy code** you want help with\n",
    "3. **Open Claude.ai** in another tab and ask for help\n",
    "4. **Paste improvements** back here and test them\n",
    "5. **Iterate** until your game works!\n",

    "### Step 1: Add Player Moves\n",
    "Ask Claude.ai:\n",
    "> \"Add a function called make_move that takes a board, a position (1-9), and a player symbol (X or O), and places the symbol at that position. Then update the code above to test it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Get Player Input\n",
    "Ask Claude.ai:\n",
    "> \"Create a function called get_player_move that asks the current player for their move and returns a valid position. For now, don't worry about validating if the position is already taken.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Create Game Loop\n",
    "Ask Claude.ai:\n",
    "> \"Add a simple game loop that lets X make one move, then O make one move, alternating for 9 total moves.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Win Detection\n",
    "Ask Claude.ai:\n",
    "> \"Create a function called check_winner that returns the winning player (X or O) if there's a winner, or None if not. Check all rows, columns, and diagonals.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Complete the Game\n",
    "Ask Claude.ai:\n",
    "> \"Integrate the win checking into the game loop so the game stops when someone wins.\"\n",
