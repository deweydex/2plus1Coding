    "# Word Guessing Game - Beginner Starter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome!** This notebook helps you build a word guessing game (like Hangman).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you're starting with:\n",
    "- A word selection function that picks a random word\n",
    "- A display function that reveals guessed letters\n",
    "- Basic structure ready to expand\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your tasks:\n",
    "1. Add functionality to let the player guess a letter\n",
    "2. Update the display to reveal correctly guessed letters\n",
    "3. Track incorrect guesses and set a limit\n",
    "4. Create a game loop that continues until win or lose\n",
    "5. Add enhancements based on your interests\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use this notebook:\n",
    "1. **Run the starter code** below to see what you have\n",
    "2. **Copy code** to Claude.ai when you need help\n",
    "3. **Paste improvements** back and test them\n",
    "4. **Build incrementally** - one feature at a time!\n",

    "### Step 4: Win/Lose Detection\n",
    "> \"Add functions to check if the player won (all letters guessed) or lost (6 wrong guesses). Display appropriate messages.\"\n",

    "### Step 5: Complete Game Loop\n",
