    "**Welcome!** Build a turn-based combat system where characters battle until one wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you're starting with:\n",
    "- Character creation with stats (HP, attack, defense)\n",
    "- Visual stat display with health bars\n",
    "- Basic structure ready to expand\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your tasks:\n",
    "1. Add an attack function where characters damage each other\n",
    "2. Create a simple battle loop with turn-by-turn combat\n",
    "3. Add win/lose conditions\n",
    "4. Add player choice (attack, defend, special ability)\n",
    "5. Enhance with abilities, items, or multiple enemies\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use:\n",
    "Run cells to see characters, then work with Claude.ai to build the battle system!\n",
