        <h1>Getting Started (Web-Based Version)</h1>

        <div class="intro">
            This guide walks you through the web-based setup using Claude.ai and Google Colab. No software installation required - everything runs in your browser! This version is ideal for Chromebooks, shared computers, or situations where installing software is difficult.
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
            <h3>Prefer Desktop?</h3>
            <p>
                If you want to install software locally and use Claude Code from the terminal, see the <a href="getting-started.html">Desktop Version</a> instead. That version offers a more integrated experience but requires installation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>What You Need</h2>
            <p>
                The web-based approach requires only a web browser and internet connection. You will use two free tools in separate browser tabs: Claude.ai for AI assistance and Google Colab for writing and running Python code. This combination provides all the functionality of the desktop version without requiring any software installation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both tools work on any modern browser including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. They work on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS. The only requirement is reliable internet connectivity, as both tools run in the cloud. If you are in a classroom setting, ensure all students can access both websites, as some schools block certain cloud services.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 1: Set Up Claude.ai</h2>
            <p>
                Claude.ai is Anthropic's web interface for Claude, providing the same AI capabilities as Claude Code but through a browser. You will use it to ask questions, get coding help, debug problems, and understand concepts. The free tier provides substantial usage that should be more than enough for this activity.
            </p>

            <h3>Creating Your Account</h3>
            <p>
                Navigate to <a href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank">claude.ai</a> in your web browser. Click "Sign Up" and create an account using your email address or by connecting a Google account. Email verification may be required. Once verified, you will arrive at the main Claude.ai interface showing a text input box where you can type messages to Claude.
            </p>

            <p>
                Familiarize yourself with the interface. The main area shows your conversation history with Claude. The text box at the bottom is where you type questions or requests. Each message you send and Claude's response appears in the conversation thread. Unlike the command-line version, the web interface maintains your conversation history visually, making it easy to scroll back and review previous exchanges.
            </p>

            <h3>Your First Interaction</h3>
            <p>
                Test the interface by asking Claude a simple question: "Can you explain what a Python function is in simple terms?" Claude will respond with an explanation. This confirms your account works and gives you a feel for how Claude communicates. Notice that responses appear gradually as Claude generates them, similar to typing.
            </p>

            <p>
                The web interface supports markdown formatting, code blocks, and even syntax highlighting. When you paste code or ask Claude to write code, it will appear in formatted code blocks that are easy to read and copy. You can copy code from Claude's responses using the copy button that appears when you hover over code blocks.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 2: Set Up Google Colab</h2>
            <p>
                Google Colab is a free cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that runs Python code in your browser. It provides all the Python libraries you need pre-installed, including those for machine learning and data science. Colab even offers free access to GPUs, making it excellent for the machine learning project.
            </p>

            <h3>Accessing Colab</h3>
            <p>
                Navigate to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank">colab.research.google.com</a>. If you have a Google account, sign in with it. If not, you can create one or use Colab without an account, though saving your work requires a Google account. The main interface shows example notebooks and options to create new notebooks or open existing ones.
            </p>

            <h3>Understanding Notebooks</h3>
            <p>
                Jupyter notebooks are documents that combine code, output, and explanatory text. A notebook consists of cells, where each cell is either code (that you can run) or markdown (formatted text for explanations). This format is ideal for learning because you can include instructions right alongside the code you write. You run cells individually, seeing output immediately below each cell.
            </p>

            <p>
                The starter code for each project is provided as a Colab notebook with the foundational code already written and explanatory text guiding you through what to build next. This gives you immediate working code to run and build upon, without needing to type everything from scratch.
            </p>

            <h3>Opening a Starter Notebook</h3>
            <p>
                To open a starter notebook from this project, click File → Open Notebook in Colab. Select the GitHub tab. Enter the repository URL: <code>deweydex/2plus1Coding</code>. Navigate to the <code>colab-notebooks</code> folder and select the starter notebook for your project. The notebook opens in your browser, ready to use.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, direct links to open notebooks are provided on each project page. Clicking these "Open in Colab" links takes you directly to the appropriate notebook without manual navigation.
            </p>

            <h3>Running Your First Cell</h3>
            <p>
                When you open a starter notebook, you will see cells containing code. To run a cell, click the play button on the left side of the cell or press Shift+Enter. The code executes, and any output (print statements, graphics, etc.) appears directly below the cell. This immediate feedback makes it easy to verify code works before proceeding.
            </p>

            <p>
                Try running the first few cells in the notebook to see the starter code in action. For example, in the tic-tac-toe starter, running the demonstration cell will display an empty game board. This confirms the notebook is working and shows you what foundation you are building upon.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 3: The Two-Tab Workflow</h2>
            <p>
                With both tools set up, you will work with two browser tabs open simultaneously. One tab has Google Colab with your code. The other tab has Claude.ai for getting help. This workflow mirrors pair programming where one person codes while the other provides guidance, except Claude is your AI pair programmer.
            </p>

            <h3>The Basic Workflow</h3>
            <p>
                The typical cycle works as follows. First, run the starter code in your Colab notebook to see what you have. Identify the next feature you want to add based on the project instructions. Copy the relevant code from your notebook. Switch to the Claude.ai tab and paste the code, along with a description of what you want to add or change. Claude responds with suggestions, explanations, or modified code. Copy the improved code back to your Colab notebook, paste it into a cell, and run it to test.
            </p>

            <p>
                This process repeats for each feature you add. The key is to work incrementally: add one thing at a time, test it, make sure you understand it, then add the next thing. Do not try to implement everything at once. This iterative approach prevents overwhelming yourself with too many changes simultaneously and makes debugging much easier when something goes wrong.
            </p>

            <h3>Example Interaction</h3>
            <p>
                Suppose you are working on the tic-tac-toe project. You have the board display working and want to add the ability for a player to make a move. In Colab, you see the <code>create_board</code> and <code>display_board</code> functions. You copy these functions to provide context, then switch to Claude.ai.
            </p>

            <p>
                In Claude.ai, you paste the code and write: "I have these functions for creating and displaying a tic-tac-toe board. Can you add a function called make_move that takes a board, a position (1-9), and a player symbol (X or O), and updates the board at that position? Include error checking to ensure the position is valid."
            </p>

            <p>
                Claude responds with the new function, explains how it works, and might suggest how to test it. You copy the new function back to Colab, add it to your notebook, and write a few lines of test code to verify it works. Once confirmed, you proceed to the next feature.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Working with Colab Notebooks</h2>

            <h3>Creating and Managing Cells</h3>
            <p>
                Notebooks consist of cells that you can add, delete, move, and edit. To add a new code cell, click "+ Code" in the toolbar or hover between cells and click the "+ Code" button that appears. To add explanatory text, click "+ Text" and write markdown. You can drag cells to reorder them or use the up/down arrows in the cell toolbar.
            </p>

            <p>
                Delete cells you no longer need using the delete button in the cell toolbar. This keeps your notebook organized and prevents confusion about which code is current. As you build your project, you will likely create many cells, test things, and delete what does not work. This iterative process is normal and expected.
            </p>

            <h3>Saving Your Work</h3>
            <p>
                Colab automatically saves your notebook to Google Drive if you are signed in with a Google account. You can see the save status in the top bar. The notebook saves as you work, but you can manually save with File → Save or Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac). Your work persists between sessions, so you can close the browser and return later to continue.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you want to download your notebook to your computer, use File → Download → Download .ipynb. This saves a local copy you can archive or share. You can also download as a Python script (.py file) if you want to run the code outside of Colab later, though you lose the markdown cells and inline output when doing so.
            </p>

            <h3>Installing Additional Packages</h3>
            <p>
                Colab comes with most common Python packages pre-installed, including all those needed for the projects in this activity. If you ever need a package that is not installed, you can install it within the notebook using <code>!pip install package-name</code> in a code cell. The exclamation mark runs a shell command. Installed packages persist for your current session but need reinstallation if you start a new session.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the projects in this activity, you should not need to install additional packages. The starter notebooks use only standard libraries that Colab provides. If you do extensions that require additional packages, Claude.ai can help you determine what to install and how.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Prompting Claude.ai Effectively</h2>
            <p>
                The web interface for Claude works similarly to Claude Code in terms of effective prompting strategies. The same principles apply: be specific, provide context, work incrementally, and test frequently. However, the copy-paste workflow requires some specific techniques to work smoothly.
            </p>

            <h3>Providing Context</h3>
            <p>
                When asking Claude for help, include enough context about your project. If you have existing code that the new code needs to work with, paste the existing code first. If you are getting an error, paste the complete error message. If something is not working as expected, describe both what you expect and what actually happens.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, rather than asking "How do I check for a winner in tic-tac-toe?", provide context: "Here is my tic-tac-toe board represented as a list of 9 elements. Can you write a function that checks all winning conditions (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals) and returns the winner (X or O) or None if there is no winner yet?"
            </p>

            <h3>Managing Conversation Length</h3>
            <p>
                Web conversations with Claude can get long. If you have been working for a while and the conversation thread is extensive, Claude may lose track of earlier context. When this happens, start a new conversation with Claude (using the "New Conversation" button) and provide fresh context about where you are in your project. Alternatively, you can summarize your current state: "I am building a tic-tac-toe game. I have board display, player input, and turn alternation working. Now I need to add win detection."
            </p>

            <p>
                The trade-off is that longer conversations maintain context but become unwieldy, while new conversations lose history but start fresh. Use your judgment about when to start over versus continuing the existing thread.
            </p>

            <h3>Copying Code Cleanly</h3>
            <p>
                When copying code from Claude back to Colab, use the copy button that appears when you hover over code blocks in Claude's responses. This copies just the code without formatting artifacts. Paste into a code cell in Colab, not a text cell. If you paste into a text cell by mistake, the code will display as text rather than execute. Delete the text cell and create a code cell instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                After pasting code, verify it looks correct before running it. Occasionally formatting can get mangled during copy-paste. If code looks strange (odd indentation, missing characters), ask Claude to provide it again or manually fix the formatting.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>

            <h3>Colab Runtime Disconnects</h3>
            <p>
                Colab provides free computing resources with some limitations. If you are inactive for a while, your runtime may disconnect to free up resources for others. When this happens, variables and outputs are lost, but your code cells remain. Simply reconnect using the "Reconnect" button and re-run the cells you need. Running all cells from top to bottom (Runtime → Run all) quickly restores your state.
            </p>

            <h3>Package Import Errors</h3>
            <p>
                If you get an error saying a package is not found, it might not be installed. Use <code>!pip install package-name</code> to install it. For the projects in this activity, all required packages should be available by default. If you do encounter import errors, they likely indicate a typo in the import statement rather than a missing package.
            </p>

            <h3>Claude.ai Rate Limits</h3>
            <p>
                The free tier of Claude.ai has usage limits to prevent abuse. In normal use for this activity, you should not hit these limits. If you do receive a message about rate limiting, wait a few minutes before continuing. The limits reset over time. If you frequently hit limits, you may be sending too many messages too quickly; slow down and think through each question before asking.
            </p>

            <h3>Code Not Running as Expected</h3>
            <p>
                If code runs but produces unexpected output, verify that you have run all necessary cells in order. Notebook cells can be run in any order, but most code assumes cells execute top-to-bottom. If you define a function in cell 5 and try to call it in cell 3, it will not work unless you have already run cell 5. When in doubt, use Runtime → Restart runtime and run all cells from the beginning.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
            <p>
                Working in the browser requires some adjustment if you are used to desktop development environments, but it offers significant advantages in accessibility and ease of setup. Embrace the notebook format by using markdown cells to document your thinking, adding comments to your code, and keeping your notebook organized as you work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Save frequently even though Colab auto-saves. Network issues can occasionally cause lost work if you have not saved. The manual save takes only a moment and provides peace of mind. If working on an important project, periodically download a backup copy to your computer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Use the two-tab workflow efficiently by keeping both tabs open throughout your work session. Constantly opening and closing tabs wastes time. Position the windows side-by-side if you have a large enough screen, allowing you to see both simultaneously. This makes the copy-paste workflow much smoother.
            </p>

            <p>
                Do not hesitate to ask Claude for explanations, not just code. Understanding why code works is more valuable than having code that works. Ask questions like "Can you explain how this function works line by line?" or "Why did you use a dictionary instead of separate variables here?" These explanations deepen your learning.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                With both tools set up and working, you are ready to begin your project. Choose a project from the home page based on your interests and experience level. Each project page provides a link to open the starter notebook directly in Colab. Review the <a href="prompting-guide.html">Prompting Guide</a> to understand effective strategies for working with Claude, then dive into building.
            </p>

            <p>
                Remember that the goal is learning through building. Take your time, ask questions when confused, and focus on understanding each piece before moving to the next. The web-based approach makes it easy to experiment because you can quickly run code and see results. Use this to your advantage by trying things, seeing what happens, and iterating based on what you learn.
